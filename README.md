## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Use NetBeans 23
- Any Java-supported operating system

### Troubleshooting!
- Issue: GitHub displays a warning: “This type of file can harm your device”   and prevents editing of .class files.

- Cause: class files are compiled Java bytecode, treated as binary             executables. GitHub restricts browser-based editing of such files to         prevent  potential security risks.
- Note: I would suggest you should clone or downlod the zip file, then you     run the chess-game.
